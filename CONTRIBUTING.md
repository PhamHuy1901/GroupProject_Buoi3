# Contributing Guidelines

## 🌟 Welcome!
Thank you for contributing to GroupProject_Buoi3! This document provides guidelines for contributing to this project.

## 🔄 Workflow

### 1. Branch Naming Convention
Use descriptive branch names following this pattern:
- `your-name/feature-name` - for new features
- `your-name/bugfix-name` - for bug fixes
- `your-name/docs-update` - for documentation updates

Example: `john/add-login-feature`

### 2. Making Changes

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b your-name/feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and commit regularly:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Clear description of your changes"
   ```

3. **Push your branch**:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-name/feature-name
   ```

4. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub

### 3. Commit Message Guidelines
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages
- Start with a verb in present tense (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
- Keep the first line under 50 characters
- Add detailed description if needed

Examples:
- ✅ "Add user authentication feature"
- ✅ "Fix navigation menu bug"
- ✅ "Update README with installation steps"
- ❌ "changes"
- ❌ "fix bug"
